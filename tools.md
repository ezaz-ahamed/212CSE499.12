# tools and technologies for the 'Can I Park Here?' PWA

for the project we've decided to push for a PWA (progressive web app)[1], which will serve as a proof of concept web-application. if all goes well, we can transfer the system to Flutter[2] based frameworks for the final implementation. 
Buliding a PWA needs some essential tools along with HTML, CSS, JS etc. A list is provided for which we are doing research on as what we might use for the implementation.

(N.B: the list is subject to change a lot depending on the  requirements)

- **Front End tools**:
	- VueJS [3] as the potential front end framework. A lot of useful tools are integrated with VueJS that smoothes out the PWA development.
	- Vue CLI[4] as the toolchain for fast VueJS based front end development.
	- Chrome Devtools, which is esentially a debugger from Chrome web-browser. Since we'll be testing the app in Chrome, Devtools is important to chross check the UI details real time.
	- Lighthouse[5] as the audit system for the front end performance for the PWA. It is an open source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages
	- Material Design[6], as the design philosophy for the UI. It is not strictly a tool but rather a visual language that synthesizes the timeless principles of good design with the innovation of technology and science.
	- Vuetify[7], as the implentation of Material Design for VueJS. Basically a semantic component framework for Vue which aims to provide clean, semantic, reusable components.
- **Back end tools**:
	- Node JS[8], as the Javascript Backend. 
	- NPM[9], a package manager for javascript. It provides a lot of packages for both the front end and back end, easing out the development workflow. 
	-  Workbox[10], a set of libraries and Node modules that make it easy to cache assets and take full advantage of features used to build PWAs.
	- Firebase[11], a service in the cloud that helps automate back-end developer tasks like database creation and handling, authentication, messaging system.
	
- **APIs**
	- Google Maps Platform API[12], the de factor API for map integration and customization for the requirements for the PWA.
