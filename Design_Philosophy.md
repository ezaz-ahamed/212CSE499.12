# Design Philosophy of the "Can I Park Here?" Progressive Web App

**Can I Park Here?** PWA is a smart parking solution for drivers. In Bangladesh, often times we struggle to find a place to park our vehicles while we are out. This is due to the lack of respect for the traffic rules, or the mismanagement of the autority. Bad parking habits creates  inconvenience to the pedestrians, as well as other drivers, it also contributes to creating traffic problems. So, we are hoping to produce a solution that will help drivers to secure a good place to park their vehicles.  The users of this PWA will enjoy various features that will save them from the struggle of finding a suitable place for parking, and traffic fines.

Although there already exists some similar parking solutions in Bangladesh, most of them require an android device to operate, "**Can I Park Here?**" being a progressive web app provides a good solution to this problem. It helps its users find their nearest free or paid  parking location in a **Quick and Easy** way.

Keeping the users' precious time in mind we have come up with a UX Design Philosophy that will provide the users the best experience. Our Design Philosophy includes:

- **Easy Navigation:** Use of user-friendly intuitive icons, and labels. Avoid using conflicting icons.
- **Content Prioritization** Easier access to the most importat features. For our app, showing the nearest parking stations, parking place booking.
- **Minimal  Data Input:** Registration, and login data will require minimal user information. More information will be asked only when necessary (payment information).
- **User Interface Design:** An attractive yet simple UI. Best use of the "thumb zone". Targets size consideration.
- **Billing System**: Payments using online banking system, as well as cash(when available).

**N.B**: Our design Philosophy might change as the work on the project progresses.
